Perhaps the most popular demonstration of this phenomenon are the modulated voices of people who have inhaled Helium.Â  The objective of lab 1 is to understand how the molecular composition of a gas determines the speed of sound waves passing through it. To make sure we are grounded in reality, we would specifically like to explain this table of the speed of sound through various gases from the Handbook of Chemistry and Physics.

For example, a molecule of Ethane has 8 atoms whereas the noble Argon has only one.

For example, Methane has more atoms than Argon but the speed of sound through Methane is greater.\n",

        "The speed of sound of various gases is experimentally measured using an acoustic interferometer. In order to use an acoustic interferometer to obtain accurate experimental measurements of a gases sound velocity, it is critical to have an accurate and precise determination of the length (L) of the acoustic interferometer tube. Measuring the length with a ruler, for example, does not provide an accurate or precise enough determination of the tube length. What is commonly done is to start with a gas that has a very well-known sound velocity and use it to calibrate and/or measure the length of the acoustic interferometer tube to a high accuracy and precision. Argon gas is often used, which has a known sound velocity of 320.0 m/s at 20$^o$C.\n",

The microphone is on one side and the speaker (earbud) on the other side. A microcontroller is setup with solenoid valves to allow computer control of different input gases. A flow meter is included after the solenoid manifold and a camera is available for a live view of the instrument and flow meter to monitor the gas flow into the tube.\n",

The data was Fourier Transformed (FT) using the Analyze > Plot Spectrum feature in Audacity.
