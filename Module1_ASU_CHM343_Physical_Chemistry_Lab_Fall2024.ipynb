The preparation for an experiment is critical and usually involves becoming familiar with the fundamental concepts, instrumentation and/or computational methods. The process of doing your own research (DYOR) through literature and background informational searching is a vital and often an underutilized component. The treatment of experimental and/or computational data, i.e., data and error analysis, is arguably the most generally applicable component and most critical for evaluating the success of laboratory experiments as well as drawing conclusions and reporting the findings of experiments and/or computations.\n",
